# Private Equity Python Contact Scraper
A similar build of an internal webscraping tool I developed to collect private equity client contacts for Bainbridge Consulting.
Overall, it resulted in collecting over 1,000 prospective client contacts for the firm's business development pipeline.
I developed this using the Selenium python library for HTML scraping and pyXL for additional Microsoft Excel compatibility.
 Automated python software that extracts and collects Private Equity Client contact information.
