# Private Equity Python Contact Scraper
A similar build of an internal webscraping tool I developed to collect private equity client contacts for Bainbridge Consulting.
Overall, it resulted in collecting over 1,000 prospective client contacts for the firm's business development pipeline.
I developed this using the Selenium python library for HTML scraping and pyXL for additional Microsoft Excel compatibility.
Automated python software that extracts and collects Private Equity Client contact information. This python script can also be used generically to adapt to different needs, not only private equity websites.
## Demo of Scraper in Action

Using an excel spreadsheet with websites or private equity firms you'd like to connect and contact, it can collect the emails present in the HTML of the websites in the spreadsheet. The scraper will execute on every provided contact website in the spreadsheet before finishing execution.
### Successful Results Printed Live

Example of the contacts it collects which it prints to console to display updated successful collection of new emails.
